# Console payment system
This project was created as an exam project during my 3rd semester at Aalborg University, in the course Object Oriented Programming.
The console payment system is a CLI replica of an existing system at the university, where students are able to buy drinks and the likes.
You can buy products by typing in your username followed by the amount to buy, followed by the ID of the product you would like to buy. If the user has enough balance to buy the products the balance will be subtracted and the purchase will go through.
